## üß© Module Descriptions

### Module 1: Core Queue Management
- Implemented by: Ian Kitheka
- Description: Handles circular queue logic, enqueuing, dequeuing, and queue status.

### Module 2: Priority & Aging System
- Implemented by: Mwai Komo
- Description: Implements priority-based sorting and aging mechanism to elevate waiting jobs.

### Module 3: Job Expiry & Cleanup
- Implemented by: Shylynn Wanjiru
- Description: Tracks waiting time, removes expired jobs, and logs expiration events.

### Module 4: Concurrent Submission Handling
- Implemented by:  Karani Claude
- Description: Supports multi-threaded simultaneous job submissions with thread safety.

### Module 5: Event Simulation & Time Management
- Implemented by: Kathy
- Description: Simulates time passage using `tick()`, updates jobs, applies aging and expiry.

### Module 6: Visualization & Reporting
- Implemented by:  Karani Claude
- Description: Provides a visual or CLI-based snapshot of the queue‚Äôs state.
